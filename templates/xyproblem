Every now and then I hear people say I might have an "XY problem". What is that?

XY Problem Explanations
=======================

* You want to do X, and you think Y is the best way of doing so. Instead of
  asking about X, you ask about Y.

* You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about
  solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a
  better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is.

* Someone asks how to do Y when they really want to do X. They ask how to do Y
  because they believe it is the best way to accomplish X. People trying to
  help go through many iterations of "try this", followed by "that won't work
  because of". That is, depending on the circumstances, other solutions may be
  the way to go.

* To answer question Y, without understanding larger problem (the context) X,
  will most likely *not* help them entirely with X.

* The XY problem is when you need to do X, and you think you can use Y to do X,
  so you ask about how to do Y, when what you really should do is state what
  your X problem is. There may be a Z solution that is even better than Y, but
  nobody can suggest it if X is never mentioned.
