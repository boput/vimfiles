It's late in the evening she's wondering what clothes to wear
She'll put on her make up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she'll ask me, "Do I look alright?"
And I'll say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"

We'll go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she'll ask me, "Do you feel alright?"
And I'll say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"

And I feel wonderful
Because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I'll give her the car keys and she'll help me to bed
And then I'll tell her, as I turn out the light
I'll say, "My darling, you are wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you are wonderful tonight"
