Nothing fancy, just to keep it safe and available.

== Colors

I use my personal colorschemes, not meant (yet?) to be shared as complete
separate thing suitable for everyone.

There are

* `colors/gruvbase.vim` -- simplified variant of `gruvbox_hard`;
* `colors/habamax.vim` -- variant of base16-default-dark;
* `colors/habamax_light.vim` -- variant of base16-one-light.

== Simple Todos

I don't need org-mode like uber feature rich solution. Simple todo lists
with checkboxes are more than enough for me.

== Active Window Autosize && Windows Layouts

Make active window 100x20 chars, and others equally even if possible (inspired
by lens.vim plugin).

Add predefined layouts, like tmux.
